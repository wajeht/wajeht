### 👋 hi there, this is *Jaw!*

<!--- This repo consists of me trying to iterate an idea to a minimum viable product. The codes are put together with a form of love that may not be as clean or follow the best practices of many of the best paradigms. So, use it at your own risk! --->

I am currently working on a system called <a href="https://gains.jaw.dev/" target="_blank">(gains.jaw.dev)</a> that can help you analyze, predict, and track many of the day-to-day variables in the powerlifting world. I am also working on <a href="https://close-powerlifting.jaw.dev/" target="_blank">(close-powerlifting.jaw.dev)</a>, a REST API on top of the open-powerlifting database, so developers can access any data easily!

If you're a student of strength, stay tuned. These systems will get you mad strong!

While you're still here, check out my cute dog pictures here <a href="https://dogs.jaw.dev/" target="_blank">(dogs.jaw.dev)</a>.
