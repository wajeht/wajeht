### Hi,

I am an athlete by heart; a disciplined individual who takes any necessary means to produce fast quality results at a higher standard. I've practiced and mastered the skill of adaptability in any situation, which makes my learning curve of learning newer technologies, skill sets, and more come at a faster rate.

My natural ambitions are to solve problems. So far, I have demonstrated histories of working with many businesses to generate more revenue, improve internal business operations, and increase pounds toward athletes' powerlifting total. Currently, I have also possessed a skill that can solve business problems with software solutions.

Check out some of the projects which I have done to solve a specific problems that I have faced personally or at a professional level.
