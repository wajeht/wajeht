### 👋 hi there, this is *Jaw!*

I am currently working on a system called <a href="https://gains.jaw.dev/" target="_blank">(gains.jaw.dev)</a> that can help you analyze, predict, and track many of the day-to-day variables in the powerlifting world. I am also working on <a href="https://close-powerlifting.jaw.dev/" target="_blank">(close-powerlifting.jaw.dev)</a>, a REST API on top of the open-powerlifting database, so developers can access any data easily!

If you're seeking for a strength coach,  <a href="https://powerlifting.gg/" target="_blank">(powerlifting.gg)</a> is an excellent resource for coach reviews.

While you're still here, check out my cute dog pictures <a href="https://dogs.jaw.dev/" target="_blank">(dogs.jaw.dev)</a>.
