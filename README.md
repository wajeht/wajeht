### 👋 Hi there,

This repo consists of me trying to iterate an idea to a minimum viable product. The codes are put together with a form of love that may not be as clean or followed the best practices of many of the best paradigms. So, use it at your own risk!

I am currently working on a system <a href="https://prime.jawstrength.com/" target="_blank">(prime)</a> that can help you analyze, predict, and track many of the day-to-day variables in the powerlifting world. If you're attracted by strength, stay tuned. This system will get you mad strong!
