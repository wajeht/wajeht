### 👋 Hi there,

<!--- This repo consists of me trying to iterate an idea to a minimum viable product. The codes are put together with a form of love that may not be as clean or followed the best practices of many of the best paradigms. So, use it at your own risk! --->

I am currently working on a system called <a href="https://gains.jaw.dev/" target="_blank">(gains)</a> that can help you analyze, predict, and track many of the day-to-day variables in the powerlifting world. If you're attracted by strength, stay tuned. This system will get you mad strong!
